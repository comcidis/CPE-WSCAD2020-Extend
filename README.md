### Folder information:


### Phase 1

Phase 1 Uses the databases in the "BaseSintetica" folder and the "BaseNova" folder. The data sets vary between 25 thousand, 100 thousand, 500 thousand, 2 million, 3 million and 5 million examples. The configuration of the features varies between 5, 10 and 21, below this distribution of the features is shown in more detail.

	5 features: 2 numeric and 3 categorical

	10 features: 5 numeric and 5 categorical

	21 features: 10 numeric and 11 categorical



### Phase 2

Phase 2 is more complex, as we will be varying the parameters, which generate large results. In addition, we are using real data, and measuring accuracy, so a database has been separated for classification ("HIGGS dataset") and for regression ("Seoul Bike Trip Duration Prediction dataset").


For classification, we have the following definition.

	Dataset: HIGGS defined in 5 million examples and 28 attributes.

	Modified parameters:
	max_depth = (default = 66,8,16,33)
	min_sample_split = (default = 2,4,8,16)
	* max_depth = default = 66 (when the tree is built without defining a value, the value goes to 66.)
	

	
For regression, we have the following definition.

	Dataset: Seoul Bike Trip Duration Prediction in 5 million examples and 24 attributes.

	Modified parameters:
	max_depth = (default = 73,8,16,33,66)
	min_sample_split = (default, 4,8,16)
	* max_depth = default = 73 (when the tree is built without defining a value, the value goes to 73.)
